### zithud

This is a hud I made for personal use. I decided to open a repository for it here.

It's designed following my preferences. It only modifies the important parts: health,
ammo, leaderboard... and it doesn't mess with any elements that aren't important in-game.

I only tested it on Linux. It should work on other platforms, but there may be some small
differences.

### Installation

You can place `zithud-master` into your `custom` folder if you want to try it out.

You should disable minimal hud if you have it enabled.
